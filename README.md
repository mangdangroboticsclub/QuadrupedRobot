## Setup

git clone --recurse-submodules <repo>
or 
git clone <repo>
git submodule init
git submodule update

## Explore the Gait Performances
You can use our Mini Pupper to explore many gait performances, such as Trot (diagonal pairs), Pace (lateral 
pairs), and the Bound (front and rear pairs). Weâ€™re confident our Mini Pupper Servos will outperform any servo 
for the balance of performance and price.
